The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is a national level board of education in India for public and private schools, controlled and managed by the Government of India.
Established in 1929 by a government resolution, the Board was an experiment towards inter-state integration and cooperation in secondary education.

More than 27,000 schools in India and 240 schools in 28 foreign countries are affiliated with the CBSE.
All schools affiliated with CBSE follow the NCERT curriculum, especially from classes 9 to 12.
The current Chairperson of CBSE is Rahul Singh, IAS.

The constitution of the Board was amended in 1952 to give its present name, the Central Board of Secondary Education.
The Board was reconstituted on 1 July 1962 to make its services available to students and various educational institutions in the entire country.
